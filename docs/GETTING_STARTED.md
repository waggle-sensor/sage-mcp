## üîß Deployment Options

### Development Mode
For development and testing, run the server directly with Python:
```bash
python sage_mcp.py
```
This allows for easy debugging and code modifications.

### Docker Deployment
For production deployments, use Docker:
```bash
# Start with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f sage-mcp

# Stop the service
docker-compose down
```

### Standalone Executable
For environments without Python or Docker, create a standalone executable:
```bash
# Build the executable (from project root)
./bundling/build.sh

# The executable will be created at bundling/dist/sage_mcp
# Copy and run on target machines without Python installed
./bundling/dist/sage_mcp
```

**Executable Benefits:**
- No Python installation required on target machines
- Self-contained with all dependencies included
- Smaller deployment footprint than Docker
- Easy distribution and deployment

**Configuration:**
All deployment methods support environment variables:
- `MCP_HOST` - Server bind address (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `MCP_PORT` - Server port (default: 8000)

Example:
```bash
MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1 MCP_PORT=8080 python sage_mcp.py
```

## üîß Advanced Usage Patterns

## Creating Custom Plugins

The SAGE MCP includes a powerful plugin generation feature that allows you to create new plugins using natural language descriptions. This is accessible through the MCP interface:

### Using the MCP Interface

Ask the MCP server to create plugins for you:

```
"Create a plugin that uses computer vision to detect and count flowering plants in camera images"

"Generate a bird species detection plugin that analyzes audio recordings"

"Help me create a plugin for monitoring air quality using environmental sensors"
```

### Plugin Creation Tool

The MCP server provides a `create_plugin` tool that you can use through natural language:

**Basic Plugin Creation:**
```
"Create a plugin called 'Flower Detector' that uses computer vision to detect flowering plants"
```

**With Specific Requirements:**
```
"Create a plugin for bird sound analysis that requires GPU, audio sensors, and uses torch and librosa libraries"
```

### Generated Plugin Structure

The plugin generator creates a complete plugin structure with:

- `main.py`: Core plugin logic with PyWaggle integration
- `utils/`: Directory for helper functions
- `models/`: Directory for ML models
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile`: Container configuration
- `sage.yaml`: Plugin metadata
- `../README.md`: Usage documentation
- `ecr-meta/`: Science description

### Customizing the Plugin

After generation:

1. Review the generated files
2. Add your core logic to `main.py`
3. Add helper functions in `utils/`
4. Update dependencies in `requirements.txt`
5. Modify metadata in `sage.yaml` if needed

### Building and Deploying

The MCP server will provide you with complete deployment instructions when it creates your plugin, including:

```bash
# Build the plugin
cd your-plugin-directory
sudo pluginctl build .

# Test locally  
sudo pluginctl run .

# Deploy to SAGE nodes (through job submission)
# Use the MCP server's job submission tools for deployment
```

### Integration with SAGE Ecosystem

The generated plugins integrate seamlessly with:
- **PyWaggle**: For sensor data access and publishing
- **SAGE Infrastructure**: Automatic deployment and scheduling
- **Edge Code Repository (ECR)**: Plugin sharing and distribution
- **Job Management**: Through the MCP server's job submission tools

**Next Steps After Plugin Creation:**
1. Review and customize the generated code
2. Test locally using pluginctl
3. Submit deployment jobs through the MCP server
4. Monitor plugin performance and data output
5. Share successful plugins with the SAGE community
